# 🎬 Movie Recommendation System

This project is a **content-based movie recommendation engine** that uses [Sentence-BERT](https://www.sbert.net/) for semantic embeddings and [FAISS](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss) for efficient similarity search. Movie descriptions are stored with their corresponding embeddings in a MySQL database, allowing real-time query-based recommendations.

## 🚀 Features

- Semantic movie search using textual descriptions or genres
- Efficient similarity matching with FAISS
- Embedding-powered querying via Sentence-BERT
- Persistent movie storage in MySQL
- Real-time recommendations with simple terminal input
